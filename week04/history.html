                    <h2>Camera Obscura</h2>
                    <p>Considered the precursor to the modern camera, this device used a small hole to project an image
                        onto a surface, allowing artists to trace it; its origins date back to ancient civilizations
                        like the Chinese and Greeks. </p>

                    <h2>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce (1816)</h2>
                    <p>French inventor who created the first camera capable of capturing a permanent image, called the
                        "heliograph," using a silver chloride coated plate; the oldest surviving photograph is
                        attributed to Niépce, taken in 1826. What Niépce did was find a way to record the image
                        projected by the camera obscura. He used a light-sensitive material called “Bitumen of Judea” or
                        “Asphalt of Syria,” a semi-solid oil, and mixed it with pewter. The result was a permanent image
                        that would survive after the camera obscura was closed. He named his method heliography, which
                        translates as “sun drawing.”</p>

                    <h2>Louis Daguerre (1839)</h2>
                    <p>Louis Daguerre continued, improved, and finally changed Niépce’s process completely. In 1839, he
                        announced a new photographic process named after him: daguerreotype. The daguerreotype requires
                        a silver-plated copper with a mirror finish treated with substances that make its surface
                        sensitive to light. The plate is exposed to light in a black box for a given period of time,
                        which can be as short as a few seconds. Then, it is fumed with mercury vapor, chemically treated
                        to become insensitive to light, rinsed, dried, and sealed in a protective glass enclosure.

                        Unlike heliography, the daguerreotype produces a much better image quality, requires less
                        exposure time, and is portable. Thus, Louis Daguerre wasn’t limited to capturing landscapes. He
                        could photograph people, still life, and street views. This made his process popular in a very
                        short amount of time. The French government bought the rights and presented the daguerreotype as
                        a gift to the world.</p>

                    <p>Introduced the Kodak camera, a roll-film camera that simplified the photographic process,
                        allowing people to take pictures without needing extensive technical knowledge.

                    <p>Following the Kodak, advancements included the 35mm film format for cinema, instant cameras like
                        Polaroid, and the transition to digital photography with significant improvements in image
                        quality and accessibility.
