		        <p>Louis Vuitton’s Fall/Winter 2025 Menswear runway show featured playful, eye-catching designs as well as new silhouettes and perspectives on men’s style.

Creative director Pharrell Williams and collaborator Nigo gazed into the future through the telescope of history by combining complex designs with thought-provoking details to prove that you can always incorporate your past into your future, especially with clothing.</p>

                <h2>BROWN IS THE NEW BLACK</h2>
		        <img src="images/R01.png">
                <br>
                <p>This cozy fall color was the star of the show on the runway. Dreamy wool trench coats and monogrammed jackets allowed the various shades of brown to fit any occasion. A rich suede jacket paired beautifully with high-rise navy blue pants, and a LV-branded baseball cap came together in a perfectly polished outfit, proving that true style doesn’t require bells and whistles to highlight  the beauty of simplicity.

                <h2>SHARP DRESSED MAN</h2>
                <img src="images/R02.png">
                <br>
                <p>The collection’s favorite silhouette was a classic style that looks good on anyone: the suit. From baggy, relaxed suits in wool and denim material to the rich, luxurious well-fitted suits that take shape in leather and embellished styles, the vast range provides a range of fashion risks.   
                </p><br>
                <h2>HANDBAGS ARE A MAN’S BEST FRIEND</h2>
                <img src="images/R04.png">
                <br>
                <p>Even though handbags are traditionally associated with women’s wardrobes, men can also rock a bag—and do it shamelessly. Crocodile-embossed LV shopper bags, lobster handbags, and steamer trunks pushed by models revived the man bag trend, hopefully a signal of the accessory becoming a staple in men’s wardrobes.</p><br>
                <h2>REAL MEN WEAR PINK</h2>
                <img src="images/R03.png">
                <br>
                <p>With the traditional fall colors such as black and brown, pink was a refreshing surprise that redefines what is considered a seasonal color. Floral-embellished Damier monogram cardigans, incredible varsity jackets, and an interpretation of an ugly Christmas sweater that makes a strong case for pink as fall’s hottest color.</p><br>
                <h2>PRINTS GALORE</h2>
                <img src="images/R06.png">
                <br>
                <p>With the cold and gloomy weather fall and winter brings, why not add fun yet interesting prints into our clothing? Known for his prints at brands like Billionaire Boys Club and Bape, this season saw Nigo’s signature influence through unique print design. Leopard print shoes make a case for statement footwear, and a new wave of LV camouflage in ready-to-wear and denim creates an eye-catching optical illusion. Both prints highlight Williams’s bold vision for the House’s menswear, offering bright designs that still incorporate Louis Vuitton’s signature codes.
