			<p>Sphynx: A unique breed with a natural lack of fur, known for their distinctive appearance and affectionate personalities. Some have whiskers and eyebrows while others do not, but they all have charming wrinkles and long toes.  </p><br>
			<p>Bambino: A newcomer to the hairless cat scene, Bambinos were founded in 2005. Not yet accepted as an official breed by the Cat Fanciers Association—they’re considered an “experimental breed”—a Bambino cat is a cross of the hairless Sphynx and short-legged Munchkin. </p><br>
			<p>Peterbald: This hairless cat breed is all ears—really, they have big perky ears that seem much too large for their wedge-shaped head. Peterbalds are rare outside of Russia, but friendly and full of energy. They like to play fetch and follow on their humans’ heels. </p>
