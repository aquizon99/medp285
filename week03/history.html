        <h2>1. What color is silver?</h2>
            <p>Silver is a solid color visually characterized by a sleek, metallic shine and typically associated with the color gray.</p>
            
            <blockquote>The best way to achieve a silver tone is by creating multiple shades of gray through the mix of black and white. By combining multiple grays and adding a final dollop of white, this will create a silver gradient. 
               
                <blockquote>Metallic silver, however, isn’t entirely a true or solid color – it’s a reflective tone that can only be attained through the use of reflective pigments, with gray as a base. To achieve silver’s bright and light hues, try a metallic paint that gleams, or try a graphic design effect that mimics light on a bright surface.</blockquote>
            
            The silver hex code is #C0C0C0.</blockquote>
